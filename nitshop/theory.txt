In React.js component is a piece of code that represents a part of a user interface.
It can be a class component or a functional component.
Class component is a js class that extends React.Component class, while a functional component is a js
function that returns only the React eleemnt


A PureComponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component,but with additional features
or optimizations.When a component is a PureComponent,
React will do a shallow compresiom of props and state before re-rendering the component. That means that if
props and state have nit changed , the component will not be re-rendering .This can lead to a performance boost in some cases,
but if it's not used property,
it can lead to unexpected behaviour.


Bottomline, a component is the most basic and most used for building a block in React and PureComponent
is used whan it needs some special optimizations.


Props (properties) is a way for manipulating data and states
We can send data through props and we can send
data to parent through props
